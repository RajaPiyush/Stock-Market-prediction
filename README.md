# Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project is centered around the analysis of a dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and possibly predictions using various regression techniques. It utilizes  Python programming languages within Jupyter notebooks to perform linear regression, multiple linear regression, and random forest regression analyses.

## Project Structure

### Input Data
- `final_merged.csv`
  - **Description**: This CSV file serves as the input data for all analyses. It contains 199034 rows and 17 columns

### Analysis Notebooks
- `linear_r.ipynb`
  - **Purpose**: To perform a simple linear regression analysis using python. It serves as an introductory analysis to understand the relationship between two variables in the dataset.
  - **Output**: Visualizations of the regression line and metrics to evaluate the model's performance, such as R-squared value.

- `multiple_linear_regression.ipynb`
  - **Purpose**: To extend the analysis to multiple linear regression in Python. This analysis explores the impact of multiple independent variables on a dependent variable.
  - **Output**: Coefficients of the regression equation, significance of predictors, and diagnostics plots to check for assumptions of linear regression.

- `Random_forest_regression.ipynb`
  - **Purpose**: To employ a random forest regression approach, which is a more advanced machine learning technique that can capture non-linear relationships and interactions between variables.
  - **Output**: The importance of each feature in the prediction, the random forest regression model itself, and performance metrics.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites
Before starting, make sure you have the following installed:
- R and the corresponding R kernel for Jupyter
- Python with Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required libraries/packages which can be installed via `pip` for Python

### Running the Notebooks
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the cloned directory.
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Open each `.ipynb` file and run the cells sequentially to perform the analyses.
